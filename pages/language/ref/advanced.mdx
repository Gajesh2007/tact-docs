Dangerous or unstable features meant to be used by advanced users only.

## readForwardFee
```tact
extends fun readForwardFee(self: Context): Int 
```
Read and computes forward fee from Context and return it as Int value in nanoToncoins.

## throw
```tact
fun throw(code: Int);
```
Throw exception with error code equal `code`.

## nativeThrowWhen
```tact
fun nativeThrowWhen(code: Int, condition: Bool);
```
Throw exception with error code equal `code` when `condition` equal True.

## nativeThrowUnless
```tact
fun nativeThrowUnless(code: Int, condition: Bool);
```
Throw exception with error code equal `code` when `condition` equal False.

## getConfigParam
```tact
fun getConfigParam(id: Int): Cell?;
```
Loads network configuration parameter from the blockchain.

## nativeRandomize
```tact
fun nativeRandomize(x: Int);
```
Randomizes the random number generator with the specified seed.

## nativeRandomizeLt
```tact
fun nativeRandomizeLt();
```
Randomizes the random number generator with the current logical time.

## nativePrepareRandom
```tact
fun nativePrepareRandom();
```
This function prepares random number generator by calling `nativeRandomizeLt` once and called internally by `random` and `randomInt` functions.

## nativeRandom
```tact
fun nativeRandom(): Int;
```
You shouldn't use this function directly, use `random` and `randomInt` functions instead.
This function generates 256-bit random number just like `randomInt` function, but random generator is not initialized by `nativePrepareRandom` function.

## nativeRandomInterval
```tact
fun nativeRandomInterval(max: Int): Int;
```
You shouldn't use this function directly, use `random` and `randomInt` functions instead.
This function generates random number in the range from 0 to `max`. This call doesn't prepare initialization by `nativePrepareRandom` function.

## nativeReserve
```tact
fun nativeReserve(amount: Int, mode: Int);
```
Calls native `raw_reserve` function with specified amount and mode. 

The `raw_reserve()` is a function that creates an output action to reserve a specific amount of nanotoncoins from the remaining balance of the account. It has the following signature:

raw_reserve(int amount, int mode) impure asm "RAWRESERVE";

The function takes two arguments:

amount: The number of nanotoncoins to reserve.
mode: Determines the reservation behavior.
mode can have the following values:

  0: Reserve exactly amount nanotoncoins.
  1 or 3: Reserve all but amount nanotoncoins.
  2: Reserve at most amount nanotoncoins.
  Additionally, mode can have the following flags:

  +2: If the specified amount cannot be reserved, reserve the remaining balance instead of failing.
  +4: Increase amount by the original balance of the current account (before the compute phase), including all extra currencies.
  +8: Negate the amount before performing further actions.
  raw_reserve() is roughly equivalent to creating an outbound message carrying amount nanotoncoins (or b - amount nanotoncoins, where b is the remaining balance) to oneself. This ensures that subsequent output actions cannot spend more money than the remainder.

> Currently, amount must be a non-negative integer, and mode must be in the range 0..15.

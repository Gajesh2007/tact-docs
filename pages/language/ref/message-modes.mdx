# Message modes

As you might've noticed, we send messages with `mode` param. To figure out the mode that best suits your needs, take a look at the following table:

| Name                 | Mode | Description                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SendPayGasSeparately | 1    | Pay transfer fees separately from the message value                                                                    |
| SendIgnoreErrors     | 2    | Ignore any errors arising while processing this message during the action phase                                        |
| SendDestroyIfZero    | 32   | Current account must be destroyed if its resulting balance is zero (often used with Mode 128)                          |
| SendRemainingValue   | 64   | Carry all the remaining value of the inbound message in addition to the value initially indicated in the new message   |
| SendRemainingBalance | 128  | Carry all the remaining balance of the current smart contract instead of the value originally indicated in the message |

## Combining modes

You can also join modes with _flags_ (modes: 1, 2, 32) in one message, for example:

```tact
let to: Address = ...;
let value: Int = ton("1");
send(SendParameters{
    to: to,
    value: value,
    mode: SendRemainingValue + SendIgnoreErrors,
    bounce: true,
    body: "Hello, World!".asComment()
});
```
